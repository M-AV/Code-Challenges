# Code Challenges
Occasionally, when I have nothing better to do, I spend some time solving code challenges. This project contains all my solutions. All of them are done for fun and for learning purposes, so don't expect any good code. :) 

What challenges are in here? 

 - In 2021 I started doing some [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in F#, mostly to learn the language. I have tried to solve all of the challenges in 2021 and 2022 (so far) in F#. A few also have a solution in C#.

 - Many years ago I did some CodeEval challenges. The site seems to be gone though.
