# Code Challenges
Occasionally, when I have nothing better to do, I spend some time solving code challenges. This project contains all my solutions.

Many years ago I did some CodeEval challenges, but the site seems to be gone.

Many of these were done for learning purposes and/or just fun so the quality probably sucks. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
