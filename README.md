# Code Challenges
Occasionally, when I have nothing better to do, I spend some time solving code challenges. This project contains all my solutions. All of them are done for fun and for learning purposes, so don't expect any good code. :) 

What challenges are in here? 

 - **Advent of Code**: 
    In 2021 I started doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in F#, mostly to learn the language.
    - F#: [2021](fsharp/AdventOfCode/2021/), [2022](fsharp/AdventOfCode/2022/), [2023](fsharp/AdventOfCode/2023/) + A few solutions from some of the earlier years
    - Rust: [2024](rust/advent_of_code/src/y2024/)
    - C#: Only a few days implemented, mostly to assist in debugging a solution from a different language.

 - **CodeEval**: Many years ago I did some CodeEval challenges. The site seems to be gone though.
